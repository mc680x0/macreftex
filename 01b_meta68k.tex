%The 68030, one of the processors found in 68k Macintosh computers. This one runs at %
%20 MHz, which wasn't found in any socketed Macintoshes... had they been socketed, %
%this grade of CPU would be found in a IIsi. All 68030s in the above packaging look %
%pretty much the same anyway. Don't worry about it too much. %

\paragraph{%
The Motorola 68000 series microprocessors were at the heart of every Macintosh %
until early 1994, when the first PowerPC-based workstations, known as Power %
Macintoshes, were released. Even after the release of the wildly successful %
Power Macintosh line, Macintoshes built around the 68040 were sold until %
their discontinuation in October of 1996. %

\paragraph{%
The Motorola 68000 microprocessor was, a full decade after its introduction to %
market, regarded widely as one of the most powerful and versatile production %
microprocessors available. It is worth noting that in this decade the %
significantly enhanced 68020 and 68030 had started to enjoy widespread use %
in workstations; no small praise then that the 68000 should stay relevant! %
}

\paragraph{%
On the topic of workstations, it is important to note a special machine which %
will not be covered in this text; the Macintosh XL. Ostensibly a repurposed %
Apple Lisa 2/10 with an Emulation Package allowing for the seamless execution %
of well-behaved Macintosh Software, the XL is not a Macintosh in the truest %
sense of the term; rather it is an inelegant attempt to recoup costs on a %
failed product. Aside from that attempting Lisa repairs or service in this %
day and age is an insane (not insanely great, merely insane) proposition, the %
Lisa falls outside the scope of this text. Information on the Lisa is, however, %
plentiful, if you know where to look, and I strongly encourage you to do so, if %
only to get a glimpse of what was a groundbreaking computer in its time. %
}

\paragraph{%
Several 68k microprocessors have been manufactured by Motorola over the years, %
and not all of them enjoy electrical similarities or code-compatibility. As such, %
it is important to note the particular microprocessors you will be dealing with. %
68000-series microprocessors likely to be found in the 68k Macintoshes you will %
come across are the 68000, 68020, 68030, 68LC040, and 68040. %
