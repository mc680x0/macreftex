'''macreftex''', or ''Classic Macintosh Hardware and Peripherals: A Field Reference for Geeks'', seeks to be a compendium of practical information regarding 
Apple Macintosh computers of the Old World variety. It is written in the hopes of enabling those who otherwise would not be capable to maintain old Macintoshes.

== What is an Old World Mac? ==
An Old World Macintosh, strictly speaking, refers to any Macintosh with the Mac OS Toolbox stored in ROM. The last of these were the Wallstreet and PDQ (Wallstreet II) in the PowerBook
line, and the Power Macintosh G3 Beige (Desktop, Minitower, AIO) in the Macintosh line. These machines, and all machines introduced prior to them, are covered by this work. 

== Credits ==
Covered better in the book, but off the top of my head I'd like to thank the [http://68kmla.net/ 68k Macintosh Liberation Army], Ian Page for creating [http://www.mactracker.net/ Mactracker], 
and all those that came before me in documenting the Macintosh series computers.
